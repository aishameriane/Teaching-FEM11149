# Assignment 1

You are the data science team of Gelukshuisje, a Dutch housing company that is expanding its business to Belgium. Gelukshuisje's business model is based on buying houses below the market price to resell for a higher value. Before entering the Belgium market, it is important to understand what are the drivers of prices there. Your team has the mission of finding this out!

In the file `housingprices_train_sample.csv` you find a listing of several properties displayed in rows. Attributes of each house are given in the columns. There are **1260** rows and **28** columns. You find the description of each variable in the file `data_description_housing_prices.txt`. The last variable, `SalePrice`, is the outcome of interest.
